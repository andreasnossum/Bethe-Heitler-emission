This repository cotains the codes related to my Bachelor's thesis names "Bethe-Heitler emission of electrons from
high-energy protons in different astrophysical environments".

The file named "Planckian_distribution" is a Jupyter notebook, and contains a code to numerically verify Eq. (66) in Kelner & Aharonian (2009).
This corresponds to Fig. (3.2.1) in the thesis.

The file named "Bethe_Heitler_emission" is also a Jupyter notebook. This file contains the algorithm to produce spectral energy distributions
of electrons from the Bethe-Heitler pair production process. The plots in this file is related to Figs. (3.2.2), (4.0.1), (4.0.2) and (5.2.1)
in the thesis.
